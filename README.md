# SKU-Generator-PHP-MySQL
This code is a simple Product SKU Code Generator that uses one main category, one subcategory, item name and the brand name to create a numeric SKU. Also has logs that tells who created any sku or who logged in the site.
Will be posting soon after filtering up some errors...
Thanks
